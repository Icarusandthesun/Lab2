# Lab2

I edited the previous code by adding a fourth quiestion that reqiured numeric input. I also gave the previous questions on the code the ability to understand capitalized and none capitalized answers. I wanted to add a counter to the numeric question that would allow the user to be informed of how many guesses they provided but I was unsucesssful.
